FizzBuzz is a famous code challenge used in interviews to test basic programming skills. It's time to write your own implementation.

Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:

if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number
if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number
for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
print the rest of the numbers unchanged.
Output each value on a separate line.  

for i in range(1, 101):
    if (i % 3 == 0) and (i % 5 == 0):
        print("fizz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("buzz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("kon")
    else:
        print(i)
