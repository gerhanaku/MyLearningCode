Write a function that takes a string and checks that:

it doesn't contain spaces,
it contains the @ symbol,
after @, there's a dot, but in a correct address a dot shouldn't stand immediately after @,
(@. should not be in the string).
Note that dots may also occur before @!


def check_email(string):
    if ' ' in string:
        return False
    if "@" not in string:
        return False
    string, domain = string.split('@', 2)
    if '.' not in domain[1:]:
        return False
    return True
